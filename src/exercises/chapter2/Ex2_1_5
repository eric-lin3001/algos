Q(2.1.5)：For each of the two conditions in the inner for loop in insertion sort (Algorithm 2.2),
describe an array of N items where that condition is always false when the loop terminates.

A：
condition j>0 && a[j]<a[j-1]
To make sure for each j, the condition is always false, we need to ensure a[j]>=a[j-1] for each j,
so one solution is [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
